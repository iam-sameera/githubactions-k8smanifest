# GitHub Actions Kubernetes Manifest Repository

Welcome to the GitHub Actions Kubernetes Manifest repository! This repository contains the Kubernetes deployment and service manifests necessary for deploying applications using GitHub Actions in a GitOps workflow.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find deployment and service manifests that define how applications are deployed and exposed within a Kubernetes cluster. These manifests are managed and updated automatically through GitHub Actions workflows, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Configure GitHub Actions Workflow:** Set up GitHub Actions to trigger workflows based on changes to this repository. Ensure that GitHub Actions is enabled for your repository.

3. **Update Manifests:** Customize the deployment and service manifests according to your application requirements. Ensure that the paths and image references are correctly configured.

4. **Commit Changes:** Once you've made the necessary changes to the manifests, commit them to this repository.

5. **Monitor Deployment:** GitHub Actions will automatically detect changes in this repository and trigger workflow jobs to deploy your applications to the Kubernetes cluster. Monitor the workflow execution and deployment status in GitHub.
